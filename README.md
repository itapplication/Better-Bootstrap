Better-Bootstrap
================

We love Bootstrap but bootstrap lack some features. 
Better Bootstrap is for fill the gap with addition of some must have features.
With Better Bootstrap you can create list with Glyphicon icons. Bootstrap provide native support for icon font Glyphicon.

How to create &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;.. list with Glyphicon
=============================================
You need to create ul with class iconlist to create particular set of icons like -
```html
<ul class="iconlist ok">
 <li>First list item.</li>
 <li>Second list item</li>
 <li>Third list item</li>
 </ul>
 ```
 <h2>Instead of set of icon create list with individual icon with each li(list) items</h2>
```html
<ul class="iconlist">
 <li class="home">First list item.</li>
 <li class="check">Second list item</li>
 <li class="remove">Third list item</li>
 <li class="check">Fourth list item</li>
 </ul>
```
